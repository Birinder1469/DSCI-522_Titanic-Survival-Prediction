Analysis of TripAdvisor ratings of Las Vegas hotels.  

This project analyzes the TripAdvisor reviews for a number of Las Vegas hotels. In particular, we are interested in whether or not a hotel's star rating is related to TripAdvisor users' scoring of the hotel. Do hotels rated above 4 stars get higher scores from TripAdvisor users? This is an inferential question. 

We plan to answer this question by first estimating the mean user scores and then performing a two-group hypothesis test. We will compare the user ratings of hotels rated above 4 stars and hotels rated 4 stars or less.
