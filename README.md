Analysis of TripAdvisor ratings of Las Vegas hotels.  

This project analyzes the TripAdvisor reviews for a number of Las Vegas hotels. In particular, we are interested in whether or not a hotel's star rating is related to TripAdvisor users' scores of the hotel. Do hotels rated above four stars get higher scores from TripAdvisor users than hotels rated less than or equal to four stars? This is an inferential question.   

We plan to answer this question by performing a two-group hypothesis test to compare user scores of hotels rated above four stars and hotels rated four stars or less.  Our null and alternative hypotheses are stated below:  

Null: The average TripAdvisor user scores for hotels rated above four stars and hotels rated less than or equal to four stars are the same.  

Alternative: The average TripAdvisor user score for hotels rated above four stars and hotels rated less than or equal to four stars are not the same.  


To summarize the results, we plan produce a plot showing where the test statistic falls on the null distribution, and a plot of the estimates with error bars for each group.
